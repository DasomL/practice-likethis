      <span>Neroli oil is an essential oil produced from the blossom
      of the bitter orange tree (Citrus aurantium subsp.
      amara or Bigaradia).</span>
      <img src="img/neroli.jpg">
      <br><span>Its scent is sweet,
      honeyed and somewhat metallic with green and spicy facets.
      Orange blossom is also extracted from the same blossom and
      both extracts are extensively used in perfumery.
      Orange blossom can be described as smelling sweeter,
      warmer and more floral than neroli. The difference between
      how neroli and orange blossom smell and why they are referred
      to with different names, is a result of the process of extraction
      that is used to obtain the oil from the blooms. Neroli is extracted
      by steam distillation and orange blossom is extracted via a process of enfleurage.</span>
      <br><span>
      Neroli (Citrus aurantium) essential oil in a clear glass vial
      It is one of the most widely used floral oils in perfumery.
      It is a nontoxic, nonirritant, nonsensitizing, nonphototoxic substance,
      but does contain known allergens.
      It blends well with any citrus oil, various floral absolutes,
      and most of the synthetic components available on the market.
      Neroli oil is a classic element in fragrance design and one of
      the most commonly used in the industry</span>
