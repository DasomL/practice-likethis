      honeyed and somewhat metallic with green and spicy facets.
      Orange blossom is also extracted from the same blossom and
      both extracts are extensively used in perfumery.
      Orange blossom can be described as smelling sweeter,
      warmer and more floral than neroli. The difference between
      how neroli and orange blossom smell and why they are referred
      to with different names, is a result of the process of extraction
      that is used to obtain the oil from the blooms. Neroli is extracted
      by steam distillation and orange blossom is extracted via a process of enfleurage.</span>
